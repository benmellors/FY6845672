    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the captivating world of investment banking, a financial sphere that plays a key role in the global economy. Investment banking isn't just about making money; it's about enabling companies to grow, innovate, and thrive. It facilitates mergers and acquisitions that reshape industries and spark innovation. But, what exactly is investment banking, and why is it relevant to you?</p>

<section id="investment-unveiled">
    <h2>Investment Banking Unveiled</h2>
    <p>Investment banking stands at the centre of modern finance, a dynamic realm where capital flows, mergers flourish, and deals materialize. It's the practice of offering financial help to governments, corporations, and high net worth individuals. IB (Investment banks) serve as agents, helping clients raise capital, manage assets, and navigate the complexities of financial markets (<a href="#ref1">Kagan, 2023</a>).</p>

    <p>They facilitate the exchange of securities, from initial public offerings (IPOs) to corporate bonds, enabling companies to invest in growth and innovation. An IPO represents a company's first sale of stock to the public, allowing it to raise capital for expansion and development. Corporate bonds, alternatively, are debt securities issued by establishments to raise funds for various purposes, often with the promise of continuing interest payments and the return of the bond's face value upon development (<a href="#ref1">Kagan, 2023</a>).</p>

    <p>To really understand these two securities, I have written examples:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>IPO:</strong> Suppose you have a super cool, successful lemonade stand, and you want to grow it into a big lemonade franchise. To do that, you need more money than you can save up from selling lemonade. So, you decide to let other people invest in your lemonade stand. You turn your lemonade stand into a company and split it into tiny pieces (shares). You then sell those pieces to people who want to invest in your lemonade business. This is like an IPO. It's when a private company (like your lemonade stand) becomes a public company by selling shares to the public (anyone who wants to invest). People who buy these shares become owners of a tiny part of the company, and if the company does well, the value of those shares can go up. So, an IPO is like the first day your lemonade stand becomes a big franchise, and everyone can be a part-owner.</p>
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Corporate Bonds:</strong> Imagine you're lending money to a big company. They promise to pay you back the money you lent, plus a little extra (interest), after a specific period. Corporate bonds are like those promises in writing. When you buy a corporate bond, you're essentially lending money to a company. (<a href="#ref3">Invest Money UK, 2023</a>) They agree to pay you back the amount you lent (the bond's face value) on a particular date in the future. In the meantime, they pay you interest at regular intervals (usually annually or semi-annually). It's a way for companies to raise money.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>These securities are vital instruments for businesses to access capital and investors to diversify their portfolios. Investment banks play a fundamental role in the underwriting, distribution, and trading of these financial instruments, shaping the financial landscape on a global scale.</p>

  <!-- Roles Within Section -->
<section id="roles-within">
    <h2>Roles Within</h2>
    <p>In the intricate realm of investment banking, professionals assume various roles, each contributing to the overall functionality of the institution. These roles can broadly be categorized into two distinct groups: front-office and back-office positions. Understanding the division and the responsibilities associated with each role is crucial for comprehending the inner workings of an investment bank (Merges and Inquisitions, 2023).</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="path/to/diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing different positions in each area of the office">
        <figcaption>To the left is a diagram to show the different positions in each area of the office.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>Front-office Roles:</h3>
    <p>These positions are primarily client-facing and revenue-generating. They involve engaging directly with clients, facilitating financial transactions, and generating profits for the bank. A notable example is the Investment Banking Analyst. These individuals are typically recent graduates responsible for conducting financial analysis, market research, and assisting in the structuring of deals. They play a vital role in initial public offerings (IPOs), mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and other financial transactions (Swathmore, 2023; Rosenbaum and Pearl, 2013).</p>

    <p>As one climbs the career ladder, they can progress to roles like Associate, Vice President, Director, and eventually, Managing Director (MD). These roles involve more significant client interactions, deal origination, and strategy development. For instance, a Managing Director often leads major client relationships and strategic initiatives, such as large-scale mergers and acquisitions (M&A) (Ross, 2023).</p>

    <h3>Back-office Roles:</h3>
    <p>In contrast, back-office positions are responsible for the bank's administrative and operational functions. One such role is the Operations Analyst, involved in post-trade processes, settlement, and ensuring the smooth execution of financial transactions. Operations Analysts work diligently to minimize operational risks and discrepancies (TopResume Editor, 2019).</p>

    <p>The career progression in the back office typically leads to roles like Operations Manager, Vice President of Operations, and Director of Operations. These individuals oversee the efficiency and compliance of the bank's operations (Prospects, no date).</p>

    <p>Understanding the distinctions between these roles is paramount in comprehending the collaboration required to make investment banks successful. From the entry-level Investment Banking Analyst to the pinnacle of a Managing Director, each position contributes uniquely to the bank's mission and financial success.</p>

    <h3>Salary Table:</h3>
    <p>Below is a table that shows the salary of each of the positions and their corresponding salary:</p>
